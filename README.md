# About DocusignTask - by SourabhSRK

 - I have fetched the data and presented in UI.
 - I have not shown the detailed card. Because it will make UI more messy. Instead onHover i am showing the details.
 - For name of emoji hover on emoji.
 - Made Custom Pagination.
 - I have set 120 icons per page, Right now it is hardcoded. But it can be changed based on user input.
 - Category is properly working.

I can upgragade this project, but dont have time right now. It was good task, enjoyed it.
